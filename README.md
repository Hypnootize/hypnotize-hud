<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud then copy the hypnotize hud folder

**2)** Navigate to (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom) and paste the previously copied folder!

**NOTES:**

If you are using a **4:3 or 16:10** aspect ration replace the all the files you find inside the (customizations/4x3 5x4 16x10 Overrides) folder over the normal hud files.

I also suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

My hud supports different customizations, it is possible to easily edit stuff like scoreboard, health styles, fonts and match status!

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

**1)** Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated file

**2)** Inside the file uncomment (by removing the // before the #base) the line of the customization you want to apply

**Other than that is also possible to easily change the colors by editing the colors.res file and enable crosshairs and hitmarkers!**
